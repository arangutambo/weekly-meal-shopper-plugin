# Weekly Meal Shopper

Weekly Meal Shopper standardizes recipe notes, parses ingredient metadata, and generates a categorized shopping checklist from a meal-plan canvas.

## Modes

- Basic: recipe view, ingredient parsing/standardization, URL + image transcription into recipe templates.
- Meal Prep: weekly canvas workflows, shopping list generation, frozen portions inventory/projection, meal-prep canvas creation.

Each mode can be toggled in plugin settings, and presets are available for quick switching (`Balanced`, `Basic only`, `Meal Prep`).

## Commands

- Open recipe view in current tab
- Standardize current recipe format
- Standardize recipe formats in configured folder
- Populate ingredient metadata from recipe section
- Transcribe recipe from URL entry (website/YouTube)
- Transcribe recipes from image folder
- Add ingredient override from current shopping list line
- Set active canvas as weekly meal plan
- Create weekly meal-prep canvas
- Generate weekly shopping list from meal-plan canvas
- Apply frozen leftovers from meal-plan canvas
- Show frozen portions available

## 5-Minute Quick Start

1. Open plugin settings and enable both `Basic` and `Meal Prep` mode features.
2. Set `Recipe folder`, `Transcribe recipes from image folder`, `Transcription output recipe folder`, and `Weekly meal-plan canvas`.
3. Turn on `Delete transcribed source images` if you want the inbox images removed after successful conversion.
4. (Optional) Run `Create weekly meal-prep canvas` to generate a fresh canvas and auto-set it.
5. Run `Standardize recipe formats in configured folder`.
6. Open your canvas and place recipe file cards.
7. Run `Generate weekly shopping list from meal-plan canvas`.

Supported image inbox formats for folder transcription include `jpg/jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, `gif`, `bmp`, `heic/heif` (Apple Photos), `tif/tiff`, and `avif`.

## Recipe Parsing + Formatting

- Ingredients are parsed from the `### Ingredients` section.
- Parsed ingredient metadata is written to frontmatter field `IngredientsParsed` (configurable).
- Ingredient formatting is configurable via template placeholders:
  - `{{Amount}} {{Unit}} {{Ingredient}} {{Preparation}} {{PreparationSuffix}}`
- Measurement presets include Vault Standard, Australian, US Customary, and custom mL values.
- Preference toggle supports weight-first conversion (`g` where density rules are available).

## Recipe View

- Split-pane recipe mode in current tab.
- Left pane: ingredients with click-to-cross-off state.
- Right pane: directions with step focus box and Vim navigation (`j/k`, arrows).
- Subheading sync across `####` sections between ingredients and directions.

## Shopping List Explainability

Shopping list output supports:

- Category reason annotations (`why: ...`).
- One-click `Override` link per line (opens override command using current line).

## Config Files (Extensibility Hooks)

- Ingredient category rules:
  - `.obsidian/plugins/weekly-meal-shopper/ingredient-categories.json`
- Unit-density conversion rules:
  - `.obsidian/plugins/weekly-meal-shopper/unit-density-rules.json`
- Unit alias rules:
  - `.obsidian/plugins/weekly-meal-shopper/unit-aliases.json`

All files are editable and can be opened from plugin settings.

## Safety + Reliability

- Transcription API requests include retry/backoff for rate limits/server errors.
- URL transcription creates a fallback recipe template if transcription fails.
- Parsed ingredient metadata is cached by file mtime/size to avoid unnecessary re-parsing.

## Settings Import/Export

- Export full plugin settings JSON for backup/presets.
- Import the same JSON back into settings from a configurable path.

Fixture-backed coverage currently includes:
- ingredient parsing + direction bolding regressions
- AU/US unit conversion behavior
- `####` section-sync grouping behavior
- shopping categorization regressions
